# Humans-Are-Fake
<br>

> All humans are fake, atleast the ones generated by this GAN!
<br>

Humans-Are-Fake is a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate human-like faces which was trained for over 8 hours using 25,000 images on NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU. In the stable model, losses for the Discriminator Network were less than 0.018 while losses for the Generator Network were less than 6.282.

### üî• Results
<br>

After training for around 35 Epochs, the GAN produced the results listed below. The following pictures were created by the GAN entirely out of its own imagination; they were never observed by it during its training phase.
